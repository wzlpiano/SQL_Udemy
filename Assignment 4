FROM fruit_imports

--1.Write a query that displays only the state with the largest amount of fruit supply.
SELECT MAX(supply), state
FROM fruit_imports
GROUP BY state

--2.Write a query that returns the most expensive cost_per_unit of every season. The query should display 2 columns, the season and the cost_per_unit
SELECT MAX(cost_per_unit), season
FROM fruit_imports
GROUP BY season

3.Write a query that returns the state that has more than 1 import of the same fruit. 
SELECT state, count(name)
FROM fruit_imports
GROUP BY state, name
HAVING count(name)>1

4.Write a query that returns the seasons that produce either 3 fruits or 4 fruits.
SELECT count(name), season
FROM fruit_imports
GROUP BY season
HAVING (count(name) in (3,4))

5.Write a query that takes into consideration the  supply and cost_per_unit columns for determining the total cost and returns the most expensive state with the total cost.
SELECT SUM(supply*cost_per_unit) as total_cost,state
FROM fruit_imports
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY total_cost desc
LIMIT 1

6.Execute the below SQL script and answer the question that follows:
CREATE table fruits (fruit_name varchar(10));
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Orange');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Apple');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);

Write a query that returns the count of 4. You'll need to count on the column fruit_name and not use COUNT(*)
HINT: You'll need to use an additional function inside of count to make this work.

SELECT count(COALESCE(fruit_name, 'somevalue'))
FROM fruits
