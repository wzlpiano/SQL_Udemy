No, there are no variables are related directly.

--2. Using subqueries only, write a SQL statement that returns the names of those students that are taking the courses  Physics and US History.

WHERE student_no IN (SELECT student_no FROM Student_enrollment
WHERE course_no IN
(SELECT course_no FROM courses
WHERE course_title = 'Physics' OR course_title = 'US History'))

--3.Using subqueries only, write a query that returns the name of the student that is taking the highest number of courses. 
NOTE: Do not jump ahead and use joins. I want you to solve this problem using only what you've learned in this section. 

SELECT student_name FROM Students
WHERE student_no IN (SELECT student_no FROM student_enrollment
WHERE course_no = ALL (SELECT MAX(course_no) FROM courses))

Subqueries can be used in the FROM clause and the WHERE clause but cannot be used in the SELECT Clause.
