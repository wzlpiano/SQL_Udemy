USING THE DATA FROM ASSIGNMENT 4
--1.Write a query that displays 3 columns. 
--The query should display the fruit and it's total supply along with a category of either LOW, ENOUGH or FULL.
--Low category means that the total supply of the fruit is less than 20,000.  
--The enough category means that the total supply is between 20,000 and 50,000. 
--If the total supply is greater than 50,000 then that fruit falls in the full category. 

SELECT name, supply,
CASE
WHEN supply <20000 THEN 'LOW'
WHEN supply >20000 AND supply <50000 THEN 'ENOUGH'
WHEN supply >50000 THEN 'FULL'
END as category
FROM fruit_imports

--2.Taking into consideration the supply column and the cost_per_unit column, 
--you should be able to tabulate the total cost to import fruits by each season. 
--The result will look something like this:

--"Winter" "10072.50"
--"Summer" "19623.00"
--"All Year" "22688.00"
--"Spring" "29930.00"
--"Fall" "29035.00"
--Write a query that would transpose this data so that the seasons become columns and the total cost for each season fills the first row?

SELECT 
SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'Winter' THEN total_cost END) as winter_cost,
SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'Summer' THEN total_cost END)as Summer_cost,
SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'All Year' THEN total_cost END)as Allyear_cost,
SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'Spring' THEN total_cost END)as Spring_cost,
SUM(CASE WHEN season = 'Fall' THEN total_cost END)as Fall_cost
